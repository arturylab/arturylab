### 👋 Hi there, I’m @arturylab

🧪 I'm a nanotechnology researcher and computational chemist pursuing innovative solutions through code and science.  
💻 Passionate about front & back end development, data science, and automation — especially when they intersect with education and real-world impact.    
🧠 I love solving problems with scientific precision and engineering creativity.

🎯 I'm looking to collaborate on:
- Scientific computing and educational platforms  
- Fronend & Backend systems for research or learning  
- Open-source tools that merge science + code  

📂 Check out my repos for projects in:
- Python development  
- Chemistry and physics simulations  
- Data visualization and quizzes  
- Machine learning for science  

📫 How to reach me:
